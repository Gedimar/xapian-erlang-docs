What do people want to search for?
----------------------------------

We can think of a large number of different things that people might want
to find from our catalogue. For instance, they may want to find objects
that were created in Nantes, or after 1812, or by Hurd-Brown Ltd. They may
want to find everything made of brass, or not containing wood, or more than
a metre in length. They may care only about objects in the National Railway
Museum, or in their Railway Heraldry collection, or everything not in the
Railway Heraldry collection. And of course they may want to look up objects
that have certain words or phrases in the title or description - "free text
search", one of the most common uses of search today.

In order to support all of this we'll need to use many of the features of
Xapian, but to get started we'll just look at one: free text search of the
title and description.

In later sections of this guide (if we ever write them), and in guides to
do specific things (if we ever convert them) we'll use the same data and
build on the system we create here.
