Building the search
-------------------

Now we have our database populated with some values, it is time for
the code to search the database and display some results.

We want to take some text from the user, and search for it in the
database; to do that we need to convert it into a Xapian Query, which
you will recall is a tree made up of terms (which in this case will be
the stemmed forms of words in the text from the user), and operations
such as AND, OR and so forth.

There are many ways to go from the user's text to a Query, but the
most simple of these is to use the QueryParser.
