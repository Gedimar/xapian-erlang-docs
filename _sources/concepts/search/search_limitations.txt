Search-time Limitations
=======================

Document ID Range
-----------------

When searching over multiple database at once, the document ids from each
database are interleaved to produce the document ids in the combined
database, so the 32-bit document id size can hit well before you reach four
billion documents - for example, if you're searching one large database and
31 small ones, you'll reach the limit of document id size on the combined
database when the largest database reaches document id 2\ :sup:`27` (about
134 million).

Also, there may be gaps in the range of used document ids, either because
you've deleted documents, or because you're explicitly setting them to
match an external system.

Positional Queries
------------------

Currently ``OP_PHRASE`` and ``OP_NEAR`` don't really support non-term
subqueries, though simple cases get rearranged (so for example, ``A PHRASE
(B OR C)`` becomes ``(A PHRASE B) OR (A PHRASE C)``).

Queries which use positional information (``OP_PHRASE`` and ``OP_NEAR``)
can be significantly slower to process.  The way these are implemented is
to find documents which have all the necessary terms in, and then to check
if the terms fulfil the positional requirements, so if a lot of documents
contain the required terms but not in the right places, a lot more work is
required than for just doing an AND query.  This will be improved in a
future release.

Collapsing
----------

You can't perform more than one collapse operation during a search.

Concurrently Open Databases
---------------------------

If you try to search many databases concurrently, you may hit the
per-process file-descriptor limit - each chert database uses between 3 and
7 fds depending which tables are present, and a process can only open a
certain number (on Linux, the default is usually 1024, so that limits you
to a few hundred concurrently open databases).  You can raise the
per-process limit on some Unix-like platforms, though you may need to be
root to do so.

.. James says:
.. Needs to mention ulimit, pam/syslimits & upstart for linux alone these days

You can address this issue (and spread the search load) by using the remote
backend to search databases on a cluster of machines, which only needs one
fd open per database on the client machine.
