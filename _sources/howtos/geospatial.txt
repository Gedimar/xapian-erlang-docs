Geospatial searches
===================

Xapian's geospatial support is currently still a work in progress, and
until it is generally available this documentation will either be
empty or may be out of date.

.. todo:: Write about how to index geolocation information, and how to use the
	  geo posting sources and keymaker to sort by distance, bias results by
	  distance, and limit results by distance.  Discuss storing geo
	  bounding boxes terms for accelerating distance limited searches.

.. todo:: Check if there is existing documentation which can be used as a
          skeleton for this.
