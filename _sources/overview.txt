Introduction
============

Xapian is an open source search engine library, which allows developers to 
add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications. 

This document aims to be a guide to getting up and running with your first 
database, explaining basic concepts and providing code examples of the 
library's core functionality.

If you just want to follow our code examples, you can skip the chapter on "Core
Concepts" and go straight to :ref:`a-practical-example` - but you should
probably make sure you have Xapian installed first!

Installation
------------

There are two pieces of Xapian you need to following this guide: the
library itself, and support for the language you're going to be
using. We've written this guide mostly using Python_ for the examples,
although we're also working on full translations into PHP_ and C++.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _PHP: http://www.php.net/

We'll be using Xapian 1.2 throughout, so let's get that onto your system.

Installation on Debian or Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recent versions of both Debian and Ubuntu have Xapian 1.2 packaged: if
you're on Debian 6.0 (squeeze) or later, or Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric
Ocelot) you can just do one of the following depending on whether you
want to work through the examples in Python or C++::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-xapian
    $ sudo apt-get install libxapian-dev

If you're still on Debian 5.0 (lenny) you'll have to `compile from
source`_, and if you're on Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) or before you'll
need to install from our PPA_.

.. _PPA: https://launchpad.net/~xapian-backports/+archive/xapian-1.2

Packages of the PHP bindings aren't available due to a licence
compatibility issue, but you can `build your own packages
<http://trac.xapian.org/wiki/FAQ/PHP%20Bindings%20Package>`_.

Installation on other systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many operating systems have packages available to make Xapian easy to
install; information is available on `our download page`_. This covers
most popular Linux distributions, FreeBSD, Mac OS (Python and C++
only) and Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio.

.. _our download page: http://xapian.org/download

.. _compile from source:

If you're using a different operating system, you will need to compile
from source, which should work on any Unix-derived operating system,
and Windows using any one of Cygwin, MSYS+mingw or MSVC. Source code
is again available from our download page, as are additional Makefiles
for building using MSVC on Windows.

Datasets and example code
-------------------------

If you want to run the code we use to demonstrate Xapian's features
(and we recommend you do), you'll need both the code itself and the
two datasets we use.

The example code is available in Python, PHP, and C++ so far, although
there's only a complete set of examples for Python at present.

.. As mentioned before, you can get the `examples in
.. Python`_, `in PHP`_ and `in C++`_, although only the Python versions
.. are complete for now.

.. .. _examples in Python: http://xapian.org/docs/examples/python.tgz
.. .. _in PHP: http://xapian.org/docs/examples/php.tgz
.. .. _in C++: http://xapian.org/docs/examples/c++.tgz

.. todo:: finalise datasets and code and link to them from here

For now, you'll want to grab the `documentation source from github`_ which
contains the example code in each language, and also the data files listed
in the next paragraph (both are in the "code" subdirectory).

.. _documentation source from github: https://github.com/jaylett/xapian-docsprint

The first dataset is the first 100 objects taken from `museum
catalogue data released by the Science Museum
<http://api.sciencemuseum.org.uk/documentation/collections/>`_, and
the second we have curated ourselves from information on Wikipedia
about the 50 `US States
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state>`_. Both are provided as
gzipped CSV files. The first dataset is released under the `Creative
Commons license Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/>`_ license, and the
second under `Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`_.
